Ninetails is a private, fast, and beautiful web browser that's created with Electron and styled with Tailwind CSS. Enjoy a clean and unique experience while surfing the web.

In this age where many browsers track their users, it's nice to have a break from telemetry and browse privately. Ninetails never collects any data, and is 100% telemetry free!

New things are constantly being added to Ninetails, so be on the lookout for new releases. You can view some features and fixes that are in the works on [this board](https://github.com/MystPi/ninetails/projects/1).
